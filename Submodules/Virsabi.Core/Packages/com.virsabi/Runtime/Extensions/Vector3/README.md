Some helpful extensions for the Vector3-class. Allows you to isolate different components of a Vector3, similar to how it is done in shader programming.

Use the following methods to isolate any given component:

```
Vector3.xIsolate
Vector3.yIsolate
Vector3.zIsolate
Vector3.xyIsolate
Vector3.xzIsolate
Vector3.yzIsolate
```

There are also methods included that calculate the intersection with a plane in 3D. More will be added in the future. Before changing these ask the author.
