This is a script originally found on Rosetta Code but re-adapted to work in Unity. It implements a simple function to map from one range to another.

The task was described as follows on Rosetta Code:
>A function/subroutine that takes two ranges and a real number, and returns the mapping of the real number from the first to the second range. Use this function to map values from the range [0, 10] to the range [-1, 0].
