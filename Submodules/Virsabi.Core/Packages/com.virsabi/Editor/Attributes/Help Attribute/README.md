Modified version of the Help Attribute by John Earnshaw. 

## Modifications 
This version allows you to toggle the Help Attribute using CTRL + H. After disabling the attribute a small bulb icon appear next to the field that has the Help Attribute. A custom GUI was implemented that shows the tooltip in a box when the user hovers over the icon.
